    "# NB1: Home-storage systems and operational strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "*Distributed energy resources* are advocated to substitute big centralized power stations in an attempt to push the decarbonization of our energy systems. With the latest advanced of renewable energy integration, particularly rooftop PV, the next logical step is to combine these with energy storage systems and improve the local consumption of the locally generated electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the consumer perspective there might be also other advantages of owning an energy storage system beyond simply an altruistic goal of maximizing autarky and a low carbon footprint. Increasing electricity prices, fading feed-in tariffs and falling ownership costs of battery energy storage systems have created the ideal conditions for the economic benefit. This has lead to a recent significant growth of the home-storage market.\n",
    "[It is estimated, that in Germany alone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06762v2) 145,000 new home-storage systems with a combined capacity of 1.27 GWh were commissioned in 2021, increasing the total installed capacity to 3.5 GWh.\n",
    "\n",
    "These batteries allow great amount of flexibility in their control, and for this reason designing proper operational strategies is an important aspect in the effort to get the most out of the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the following:\n",
    "- Time-series simulation of battery energy storage systems.\n",
    "- Techno-economic analysis of home-storage systems.\n",
    "- The impact of operational strategies on the system performance."
