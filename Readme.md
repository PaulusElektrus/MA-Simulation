# MA - Battery Storage Simulation

For my masters thesis I want to develop a battery storage for a "Balkonkraftwerk".

I used two simulation approaches in advance:

1) Using a python script for dimensioning. The code is based on the code in /sourceCode folder --> auslegung.py

2) Using a tool called [SimSES](https://gitlab.lrz.de/open-ees-ses/simses), see also this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.103743) for in detail operation insights --> simSES.py

# Results

Can be found under /results

- SimSES results in /SimSES --> open the Results.html of desired simulation in browser

- auslegung.py in /auslegung as .csv and .ods

# Plots 

Can be found [here](https://github.com/PaulusElektrus/MA-Plots/tree/main/Simulation/results).
